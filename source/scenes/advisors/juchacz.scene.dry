= Marie Juchacz

Juchacz is the founder of the Worker's Welfare, our mutual aid organization; her experiences as a single mother in poverty led her to socialism. She is the most senior woman among the S&D leadership, who is often treated as the "go-to" when the predominantly male leadership sought out womens' voices.

Juchacz's strategies for organizing women are aimed at working-class housewives, and acknowledge women's traditional household roles. We argue that our economic welfare programs will improve the livelihoods of women and their families.

[? if snd_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]
