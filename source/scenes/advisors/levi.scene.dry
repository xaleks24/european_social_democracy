@building_the_left
title: Building the Left
subtitle: Push the S&D to the left.

We have increased the strength of the left faction with the S&D. This raised concern among the moderate reformists in the party.

@kpd_cooperation
title: Cooperation with the KPD
subtitle: Any cooperation between the parties requires compromise from the KPD as well as the S&D.

choose-if: advisor_action_timer = 0
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; left_strength += 5; kpd_relation += 6*(1-dissent); reformist_dissent += 3; communist_coalition += 1 if kpd_cooperation_seen <= 1; kpd_cooperation_seen += 1

Levi attempts to reach out to his former colleagues to dissuade the KPD from their current extreme Stalinist path. Some concessions are extracted.
