= Confronting Antisemitism

Antisemitism has long been a latent feature of German society, but since the beginning of the economic depression, it has grown to a horrifying extent. The Nazis are the worst of it, but all the right-wing parties are deeply antisemitic. Regarding the S&D specifically, our right-wing enemies love to deploy their racist rhetoric against our many Jewish comrades, magnifying criticism of any minor transgression, and they call the entire S&D a Jewish party. We are a favorite target of their invectives.

- @socialism_of_fools: Antisemitism is the "socialism of fools". We will defeat them with real socialism.
- @if: Antisemitism is a crisis. Direct the full force of the Iron Front against antisemitism.
- @all: All Germans will suffer from fascism, not just the Jews. We do not need a separate policy for them.

@socialism_of_fools

The best policy to deal with this sort of irrational, senseless hatred is to ignore it. Few are swayed by racist rhetoric; the best way to combat it is to provide economic security so that people do not turn to antisemitism.

We develop an entire campaign against antisemitism under the auspices of the Iron Front. Hopefully our campaign can sway the workers away from Nazism.

@all

We do not need any special treatment for minorities.
