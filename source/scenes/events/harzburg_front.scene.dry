= The Harzburg Front

The far-right parties and paramilitaries - the NSDAP (and its paramilitary the SA), the Stahlhelm paramilitary group, and the FED - have united to form the Harzburg Front, as a force dedicated to the overthrow of the current government.

- @strategy: We must develop a coherent strategy to combat the Right.
- @confronting_nazis.iron_front: We must form the Iron Front!
- @iron_front: The Iron Front will be our answer!
