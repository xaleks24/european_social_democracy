= Unions Declare Independence

Our policy choices have greatly offended the labor movement. Union leaders have declared that they are independent of any political party, and some have been seen seeking accomodation with the LEP and even the NSDAP.

Most workers remain loyal to the S&D, although their affiliation is less solid. Many workers move left[? if sapd_formed:, to the LEP or the nascent SAPD?]. Others move in a more nationalist direction, as the ADGB signals its willingness to work with the right to solve the economic crisis.

Much of our working-class base has defected, and labor's influence in our party has greatly diminished.
