Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

- @cancel_elections_2: Yes, do it.
- @election_algorithm: No, let's hold the elections.

In response to the LEP's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The LEP has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that the Popular Front would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them.

- @ministries: First, we must select our ministries.


@popular_front_civil_war
on-arrival: lep_relation = 80; reichswehr_loyalty += 0.25;

In response to the LEP's entrance into the government, the right-wing immediately launches a coup attempt. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop us from taking power.

The Center manages to diffuse some of the hostility from the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, but fail to prevent the outbreak of fighting. We are forced to fight on the same side as the LEP, whether we want to or not.

The reactionary establishment is still very skeptical of the Nazis, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Kurt von Schleicher, a former general, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the Nazis.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Reichstag. Despite his support for a coalition with the UFCP, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

@far_right_braun
on-arrival: coup_progress += 2

President Braun faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left, suggest that the Nazis would not *truly* be as horrific as their platform suggests, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Braun could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Article 48 has been used by Hindenburg to promulgate anti-democratic and anti-worker policies; can Article 48 be used for good as well as evil?

The LEP is still very reluctant to join a coalition, despite grassroots friendliness between our memberships. The Stalinist leadership is vehemently against such a thing. They demand the appointment of Ernst Thälmann as chancellor in exchange for a coalition. [? if president == "Hindenburg" : There is no chance whatsoever that President Hindenburg would approve of the appointment of a die-hard communist as chancellor. ?] Alternatively, if our relations with them are good enough, we could convince them to support the appointment of one of our centrist or left-leaning members as chancellor.

Immediately, [+ chancellor +] goes to work building a "Soviet Germany": consolidating as much power as possible in the LEP, purging state institutions of anti-communists, and sending street fighters against the "enemies of the people".

In response to [+ chancellor +] being appointed Chancellor, the right-wing forces launches almost immediately launch an attempted coup. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop the LEP from taking power. We are forced to be on the same side as the LEP, whether we want to or not.

Somehow, surprisingly, the left coalition is successfully formed, without appointing Thälmann as chancellor. The consensus choice for chancellor, accepted by the S&D, LEP, and President [+ president +], is Rudolf Breitscheid, who belongs to the centrist faction of the S&D, but was acceptable to the left due to his previous membership in the left-wing anti-war US&D.

In response to the LEP's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The LEP has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" in the worker's government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that we would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them. 

Whatever their reasoning is, the S&D has control over the ministries of government.

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of Brüning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the S&D votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the UFCP, LEP, and FED. The stumbling block are the minor conservative parties such as the "Economic Party of the Middle Class", who detest any hint of socialism and would ruin the country before working with Marxists.

There is no path to a majority government. Hindenburg is displeased with Papen, and calls on him to resign. Now, former army general Kurt von Schleicher has been appointed chancellor, again as part of a presidential government.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Reichstag. Despite his support for a coalition with the UFCP, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.
