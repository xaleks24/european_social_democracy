= Center Party Conference

# reference: Evans, Ellen L. “Adam Stegerwald and the Role of the Christian Trade Unions in the Weimar Republic.” The Catholic Historical Review 59, no. 4 (1974): 602–26.

Wilhelm Marx, former Center Party chancellor and presidential candidate, has chosen to resign from leadership of the Center Party. Now, the party holds a conference to replace him.

The consensus candidate on the right is Ludwig Kaas, a Catholic priest who represents the party's traditionalists. On the other hand, there is Joseph Joos, a leader of the Catholic trade unions, who has been more supportive of cooperation with the S&D than most of the Center Party.

- @kaas: The Center Party elects Ludwig Kaas as the party chair.
- @joos: Influence the Center Party to select Joseph Joos as the party chair.
- @joos_campaign: We must hold a campaign in support of Joseph Joos as party chair.

@kaas
on-arrival: z_party_leader = "Kaas"; z_relation -= 5

Ludwig Kaas has been selected as the chairman of the Center Party. He seems to represent a rightward turn from Marx, and will preside over a Center Party less inclined to compromise with the left.

@joos
unavailable-subtitle: Our relations are not good enough.
subtitle: Joos is likely to be friendlier to us than Kaas.

on-arrival: z_party_leader = "Joos"; catholics_snd += 5; workers_z += 3

With our grassroots connections, we have been able to influence the Center delegates to support Joseph Joos as the new Center chairman. He has long been a friend of the S&D, and will be more inclined to collaborate with us compared to Kaas. He also increases the appeal of the Center Party to the working class.

on-arrival: resources -= 1; z_party_leader = "Joos"; catholics_snd += 5; workers_z += 3

With our grassroots connections as well as a professional campaign, we have been able to influence the Center delegates to support Joseph Joos as the new Center chairman. He has long been a friend of the S&D, and will be more inclined to collaborate with us compared to Kaas. He also increases the appeal of the Center Party to the working class.
